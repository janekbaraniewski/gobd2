// Package gobd2 provides an interface for communicating with OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) compliant vehicle systems.
//
// It allows users to interact with various sensors and control units in a vehicle, retrieving diagnostic information
// such as engine RPM, vehicle speed, and diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs). The package abstracts the underlying
// communication protocol and provides a simple API for querying and interpreting data from the vehicle's OBD-II system.
